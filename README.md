# Video Download Extension
<img src="chrome/icon.png" width="100">
This extension for Chrome and Firefox allows you to take a screenshot of any video on any website, in the best quality and without unwanted UI elements!
Just press `ctrl + alt + S`!


## How to Install

### Firefox
Just download it from 

### Chrome (or Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, etc.)
I haven't put it on the Chrome Web Store so far, as I'm hesitant to give Google my credit card info. (I only use my credit card for emergencies like getting John Wick out of trouble.)
Therefore, you have to manually install it as follows:
1. Download the newest version (the first zip file) from https://github.com/perguto/Craiyon-Download-Button/releases/.
2. Open "chrome://extensions", activate "developer mode" by toggling the switch in the upper right corner, click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.
